# Solutions_of_HDLBits
[HDLBits]([HDLBits (01xz.net)](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Main_Page)) is a excellent site for people to practice Verilog, the link of it is offered in the front. Thanks to the people who contribute to this site, there are lots of problem sets for exercising. In this project, I shared  all my solutions of  problem sets  in [HDLBits](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Main_Page). I hope everyone who loves verilog could learn together and give some valuable advice.
